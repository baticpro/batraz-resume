# My website's sources

About one year I was plannig to create my own website. 
I'm lazy and make it only during last two weeks when I have free time for that. 

I made it and now is time to refactor my creepy directory stucture :scream:

I've deployed it to AWS and it should available on [baticpro.dev](https://baticpro.dev)
